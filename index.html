      <p> <img src="assets/images/pictureofmyself.png" id="image1" alt="SeriousPictureofMaria" style="height:250px;">
        My name is Maria Joaquina Gonzalez. I was born and raised in New Jersey. I'm proud to be Mexican-American and love the fact that I was able to grow up in such a culturally rich enviornment. I graduated from Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey in 2016/ (Side note Obama was my commencement speaker and it was amazing). I graduated with a B.A. Psychology. I actually minored in Anthropology, and have some science background because I thought I wanted to do Med School one day (much ragret). I have a job and I live in hoboken and I'm really obsessed with Bears. As soon i turned 18, i was like BEAR TATTOO lets go. I'm not sure what else to write but i didn't want to keep using the latin filler text because i see it a lot at work.
